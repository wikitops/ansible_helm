# Ansible : Playbook Helm

The aim of this project is to deploy Helm on Vagrant instance.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to run this Ansible playbook :

*   [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/) must be installed on your computer
*   Update the Vagrant file based on your computer (CPU, memory), if needed
*   You must have download the ubuntu Xenial64 vagrant box :

```bash
$ vagrant box add https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/xenial64
```

### Usage

A good point with Vagrant is that you can create, update and destroy all architecture easily with some commands.

Be aware that you need to be in the Vagrant directory to be able to run the commands.

#### Build Environment

Vagrant needs to init the project to run and build it :

```bash
$ vagrant up
```

After build, you can check which virtual machine Vagrant has created :

```bash
$ vagrant status
```

If all run like it is expected, you should see something like this :

```bash
$ vagrant status

Current machine states:

helm01                   running (virtualbox)
```

#### Deployment

To deploy the Helm instance, you just have to run the Ansible playbook helm.yml with this command :

```bash
$ ansible-playbook helm.yml
```

If everything run as expected, you should connect to the server and check the Helm client version :

```bash
$ helm version
Client: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.9.1", GitCommit:"20adb27c7c5868466912eebdf6664e7390ebe710", GitTreeState:"clean"}
```

#### Destroy

To destroy the Vagrant created, just run this command :

```bash
$ vagrant destroy
```
